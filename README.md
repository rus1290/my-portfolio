# Portfolio Project

## Goal of this Project
The purpose of this project is to showcase to the potential employer my skills, through projects I had created, provide with the resume, tell a little about my self and provide the potential employer with my contact info.

## Structure of a Webpage
I had divided my Portfolio webpage into four sections:
### About Me 
This section provides some background information about me, such as my background, work experience and etc.
### My Projects section 
Showcases to the potential employer various projects that I had built through out my study as a web developer.
### My Resume
Provides my resume with more detailed information on my professional background and work experience.
### Contact Me
This section provides the user with the information on how to reach me.

## Makeup of a Webpage
I had used HTML to structure my webpage, taking into consideration best practises for structuring webpages, such as taking into consideration semantic elements, proper order of h tags and using appropriate tags such as: main, nav, footer and other, in accordance with their corresponding sections.
I've used style.css file to add some styling to my webpage through CSS  properties, used classes and ID's, created in my HTML file, to display the content of a webpage in the way that I want, and also used flex-box to make the webpage responsive.
